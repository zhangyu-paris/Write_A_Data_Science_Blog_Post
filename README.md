## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. 
I chose PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities from Kaggle.
As a Chinese, I am quite interested in the pollution situation in China, and apply data analysis skills here.

My key interests would be:

Question 1: During the day, when has worst air quality? And when has best air quality?

Question 2: During the year, when has worst air quality? And when has best air quality?

Question 3: Which city has worst air quality?

Question 4: Does the air quality improve these 6 years?

Question 5: During the day correlation between hour, DEWP, HUMI, PRES, TEMP, Iws, precipitation, Iprec and PM?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Repository Data contains the air quality data for Shenyang, Chengdu, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai from the year 2010 to 2015. 

There is also a notebook [A Study of PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities.ipynb](https://github.com/zhangyu-paris/Write_A_Data_Science_Blog_Post/blob/master/A%20Study%20of%20PM2.5%20Data%20of%20Five%20Chinese%20Cities.ipynb) available here  to showcsae all my work related to my five questions.
