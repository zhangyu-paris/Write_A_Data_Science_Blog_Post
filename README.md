## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. 
I chose PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities from Kaggle.
As a Chinese, I am quite interested in the pollution situation in China, and apply data analysis skills here.

My key interests would be:

1. [TBD]
2. [TBD]
3. [TBD]

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Repository Data contains the air quality data for Shenyang, Chengdu, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai from the year 2010 to 2015. 

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](TBD) available



## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pm25-data-for-five-chinese-cities). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
